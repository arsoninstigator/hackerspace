# hackerspace (club)
an after-school club in new delhi, india that caters towards young middle school / high school aged girls and nudges them in the direction of tech/STEM. this is done by running coding workshops, building projects together, inviting mentors, asking questions and a whole lot of trial and error. <br><br>

we usually meet every other week on saturdays at [redacted] makerspace in south delhi or online via zoom. we send out general interest forms towards the beginning of each semester but registration is open all year round on a rolling basis and it is completely free! all you need to become a member is:
- be a female under the age of 19
- have a laptop / chromebook / device to hack on
- a willingness to learn, enthusiasm and dedication

the website is currently a work in progress but you can send me a dm to register or show interest
